For interactive computing, where convenience and speed of experimentation is a priority, data scientists often prefer to grab all the symbols they need, with `import *`. Therefore, fastai is designed to support this approach, without compromising on maintainability and understanding.\n\nIn order to do so, the module dependencies are carefully managed (see next section), with each exporting a carefully chosen set of symbols when using `import *`. In general, for interactive computing, you'll want to import from both `fastai`, and from one of the *applications*, such as:"

   "source": "At the base of everything are the two modules [`core`](/core.html#core) and [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core) (we're not including the `fastai.` prefix when naming modules in these docs). They define the basic functions we use in the library; [`core`](/core.html#core) only relies on general modules, whereas [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core) requires pytorch. Most type-hinting shortcuts are defined there too (at least the one that don't depend on fastai classes defined later). Nearly all modules below import [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core).\n\nThen, there are three modules directly on top of [`torch_core`](/torch_core.html#torch_core): \n- [`data`](/vision.data.html#vision.data), which contains the class that will take a [`Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) or pytorch [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) to wrap it in a [`DeviceDataLoader`](/data.html#DeviceDataLoader) (a class that sits on top of a [`DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) and is in charge of putting the data on the right device as well as applying transforms such as normalization) and regroup then in a [`DataBunch`](/data.html#DataBunch).\n- [`layers`](/layers.html#layers), which contains basic functions to define custom layers or groups of layers\n- [`metrics`](/metrics.html#metrics), which contains all the metrics\n\nFrom [`layers`](/layers.html#layers), we have all the modules in the models folder that are defined. Then from [`data`](/vision.data.html#vision.data) we can split on one of the four main *applications*, which each has their own module: [`vision`](/vision.html#vision), [`text`](/text.html#text) [`collab`](/collab.html#collab), or [`tabular`](/tabular.html#tabular). Each of those submodules is built in the same way with:\n- a submodule named [`transform`](/vision.transform.html#vision.transform) that handles the transformations of our data (data augmentation for computer vision, numericalizing and tokenizing for text and preprocessing for tabular)\n- a submodule named [`data`](/vision.data.html#vision.data) that contains the class that will create datasets and the helper functions to create [`DataBunch`](/data.html#DataBunch) objects.\n\nThis takes care of building your model and handling the data. We regroup those in a [`Learner`](/basic_train.html#Learner) object to take care of training. More specifically:\n- [`callback`](/callback.html#callback) (depends on [`data`](/vision.data.html#vision.data)) defines the basis of callbacks and the [`CallbackHandler`](/callback.html#CallbackHandler). Those are functions that will be called every step of the way of the training loop and can allow us to customize what is happening there;\n- [`basic_train`](/basic_train.html#basic_train) (depends on [`callback`](/callback.html#callback)) defines [`Learner`](/basic_train.html#Learner) and [`Recorder`](/basic_train.html#Recorder) (which is a callback that records training stats) and has the training loop;\n- [`callbacks`](/callbacks.html#callbacks) (depends on [`basic_train`](/basic_train.html#basic_train)) is a submodule defining various callbacks, such as for mixed precision training or 1cycle annealing;\n- `learn` (depends on [`callbacks`](/callbacks.html#callbacks)) defines helper functions to invoke the callbacks more easily.\n\nThe module [`tta`](/tta.html#tta) (for Test Time Augmentation) depends on [`basic_train`](/basic_train.html#basic_train), the module [`collab`](/collab.html#collab) (for collaborative filtering) depends on [`basic_train`](/basic_train.html#basic_train) and [`layers`](/layers.html#layers), so does the module [`vision.train`](/train.html#train) (for our models with a skeleton trained on imagenet and a custom head for classification) and the module [`text.train`](/train.html#train) (to automatically get learner objects for NLP) depends on [`callbacks`](/callbacks.html#callbacks) (specifically the [`rnn`](/callbacks.rnn.html#callbacks.rnn) callback) and [`models`](/models.html#models) (specifically the rnn models).\n\nHere is a graph of the key module dependencies:"
