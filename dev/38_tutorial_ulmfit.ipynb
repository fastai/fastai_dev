xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

xxmaj the xxmaj t - shirt franchise has been a success ! \\n\\n xxmaj our sense of xxunk is surely due to xxmaj peter xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj benjamin xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxunk their screenplay solely on xxmaj xxunk 's memoirs . xxmaj so , like a poor student who has read only xxup one of his xxunk xxunk for his xxunk , xxmaj soderbergh 's product is xxunk limited in perspective . \\n\\n xxmaj the audience is held captive within the same xxunk knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the \" revolutionaries \" , but that does n't xxunk our sympathy . xxmaj instead , it xxunk on us that \" ah , xxmaj soderbergh 's trying to xxunk his audiences the same as the xxmaj latino peasants were at the time \" . xxmaj but these are the xxup same illiterate xxmaj latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . xxmaj why does xxmaj soderbergh feel the need to xxunk us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? xxmaj such audience xxunk must have a purpose . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 is more xxunk than xxmaj part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character xxunk . deltoro 's xxmaj che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to xxunk his own ill - xxunk troops . xxmaj the only xxunk is the humour as xxmaj che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant \" revolutionaries \" , some of whom xxunk lack self - control around local peasants or food . xxmaj we certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any xxunk xxunk of their xxunk xxunk , such as it was . \\n\\n xxmaj part2 's excruciating xxunk remains xxunk episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or xxunk . xxmaj thus even the scenes with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) are unexpected and disconcerting . xxmaj any xxunk events are portrayed xxunk and xxmaj latino - xxunk , with xxmaj part1 's interviews replaced by time - xxunk xxunk between the corrupt xxmaj xxunk president ( xxunk de xxmaj xxunk ) and xxup us xxmaj government xxunk promising xxup cia xxunk ( ! ) . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of xxmaj part2 's \" woods \" and day - for - night blue xxunk just xxunk the audience until they 're xxunk the xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj perhaps deltoro felt too xxunk the frustration of many non - american xxmaj latinos about never getting a truthful , xxunk history of xxmaj che 's exploits within their own countries . xxmaj when foreign xxunk still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular xxmaj american indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( \" i may not be able to read or write , but xxmaj i 'm xxup not xxunk xxmaj inspector xxmaj xxunk ) ) out to their own local cinemas . xxmaj the film 's obvious xxunk and gross over - xxunk hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the xxunk of the less - informed xxup who xxup still xxup speak xxup little xxmaj english . xxmaj if they did , they 'd have read xxunk on the subject already , and xxunk the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should . \\n\\n xxmaj such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate xxmaj latinos of xxmaj central and xxmaj south xxmaj america -- yet it 's what xxmaj che(2008 ) xxunk fails to deliver . xxmaj soderbergh xxunk his lead because he 's weak on narrative . i am xxunk why xxmaj xxunk deltoro deliberately chose xxmaj soderbergh for this project if he knew this . xxmaj it 's been xxunk , hindsight about xxmaj xxunk was xxunk wanted : it 's what i went to see this film for , but the director xxunk robs us of that . \\n\\n xxmaj david xxmaj stratton , writing in xxmaj the xxmaj australian ( xxunk ) observed that while xxmaj part1 was \" uneven \" , xxmaj part2 actually \" goes rapidly downhill \" from there , \" xxunk xxmaj che 's final campaign in xxmaj xxunk in excruciating detail \" , which \" … feels almost unbearably slow and turgid \" . \\n\\n che : the xxmaj xxunk aka xxmaj part2 is certainly no xxunk for xxmaj xxunk , painting it a picture of misery and xxunk . xxmaj the entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject . \\n\\n xxmaj the rest of this xxunk cinema xxunk is just confusing , irritating misery -- xxunk , for a xxmaj soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . xxmaj it is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a xxunk about the xxunk / 10 )</td>\n",

! xxmaj take my hand , lets xxunk : \\n\\n xxmaj the most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself . xxmaj james is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body , the one you 'd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before xxunk for xxunk xxunk . xxmaj why they chose to cast xxmaj james as the leading man is beyond me . xxmaj god knows there 's so many other hotter and xxunk homosexual men out there dying to be on xxup tv . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from his rather average physical appearance , xxmaj james is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk . xxmaj even as such , he has this arrogant , xxunk xxunk xxunk about him . xxmaj however , if xxmaj james were standing up against a blank , white wall he 'd xxunk right into in it . i honestly ca n't recall a single interesting or xxunk thing xxmaj james said during the course of the show . xxmaj he is xxup that boring and forgettable . xxmaj in fact , one of the mates flat out xxunk him he was n't feeling a connection . i thought that was the best part of the show . xxmaj also , xxmaj james speaks with an excruciatingly annoying xxunk . xxmaj sound feminine or sound xxunk , but do n't xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk xxunk in the middle of sentences … so painful to sit through . i hated him so much all throughout the show i kept thinking , \" please choose a straight guy and xxunk yourself and your unfortunate looking hag \" \\n\\n xxmaj then we have the suitors . a remarkably bland bunch of men who do n't seem to care either way what is happening . xxmaj equally xxunk , they seem to be xxunk from one guy to the next except , \" hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair \" xxmaj again , xxunk inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show . xxmaj while it may be hackneyed to type cast roles , it would 've been a lot more entertaining to watch than these xxunk drones . xxmaj however , in all their xxunk they still manage to upstage xxmaj james ( which is n't all that hard to do anyway ) , slightly that is . xxmaj you know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man . xxmaj and the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around xxup each xxup other than with the leading man ? xxmaj very sad . \\n\\n xxmaj also , i just thought that xxmaj i d point something mentioned on the message xxunk which i felt was actually true : the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys . \\n\\n xxmaj do n't get me wrong , xxmaj i m not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring , as a matter of fact i found some of them very cute . xxmaj it 's just that overall they were just xxup blah compared to the men you 'd see on shows like a xxmaj shot xxmaj at xxmaj love with xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk or xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk . \\n\\n i do n't know how many times i hit fast forward during this show . i can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box , i can accept the xxunk , xxunk suitors but xxup please for the love of xxmaj god entertain me just a little . xxmaj no such luck . \\n\\n xxmaj if you 're expecting drama , intrigue , xxunk , or excitement you will be xxup severely disappointed . xxmaj the biggest \" drama \" comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in xxmaj new xxmaj york ( how xxunk ! ) . xxmaj as xxunk as that may be i guarantee you , that is the xxup only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show . \\n\\n xxmaj sure there is the twist , but if you have any semblance of xxmaj xxunk in you , you 'll easily xxunk who 's who ( it was n't hard at all , i was only wrong once . ) xxmaj this show is stacking so much of its xxunk on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else . \\n\\n xxmaj we get to watch as xxmaj james &amp; xxmaj co xxunk along such exciting activities such as learning how to xxmaj western step dance , shopping for xxunk , visiting a xxunk xxunk , and gay xxunk . xxup yawn . xxmaj sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway . xxmaj that 's one of main problems with the show : xxup no xxup one seems to be enjoying themselves -- they are there just going through the motion trying xxunk hard to appear to have a good time . xxmaj and you really ca nt blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lame . \\n\\n xxmaj finally , the physical aspect is not there . xxmaj there 's no xxunk , no xxunk , no kissing ( ! ) , no xxunk of any sort . xxmaj it 's just \" ok that was a boring date , xxmaj i m gon na go back to my ugly , tacky wanna - be xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk dwelling ( quick xxunk on the lips ) xxup xxunk . \" xxmaj this show is so xxrep 4 * xxunk xxunk it 's ridiculous . i can understand them not wanting to play up the xxunk xxunk nature of homosexual men , but come the xxrep 4 * on . xxmaj people who watch reality xxup tv shows are gon na want more than xxunk xxunk and xxunk kisses . xxmaj this show refuses to compromise . \\n\\n xxmaj sorry if this was long winded but i felt these were issues that needed to be xxunk . i do commend xxmaj bravo for first putting up a show of this nature , but the xxunk incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind xxunk . xxmaj to summarize my three points : xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring + xxmaj boring = go do something else . xxmaj you 'll have more fun waiting at a doctor 's office for an xxunk , at least they have interesting xxunk there .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxmaj the 1930s saw a xxunk for documentary films about remote xxunk of the world , with an emphasis on wild animals , exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual xxunk . xxmaj despite the xxunk of xxunk a film crew to a distant and dangerous place , and then bringing 'em back alive ( with the film footage ) , such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional xxmaj hollywood features … because there were no expensive sets , costumes , or high - xxunk movie stars . \\n\\n xxmaj the most successful makers of such films ( xxunk and xxunk ) were the team of xxmaj martin xxup xxunk xxmaj johnson and his wife xxmaj osa , who made several documentaries ( sometimes with blatantly staged events ) in xxmaj africa and xxmaj asia . xxmaj the xxmaj johnsons ' safari films were extremely popular , inspiring several xxunk … most notably xxmaj wheeler &amp; xxmaj xxunk 's \" so xxmaj this is xxmaj africa \" , in which the very sexy xxmaj esther xxmaj xxunk plays a character named xxmaj mrs . johnson - xxunk ( instead of xxmaj martin xxup xxunk xxmaj johnson , xxunk ? ) . xxmaj although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time , the xxmaj johnsons ' films were the most popular in this genre because they xxunk heavily on humour . xxmaj viewed from our own more enlightened ( i hope ) standpoint , this is a serious flaw in the xxmaj johnsons ' documentaries : there are too many scenes in which the funny little xxunk or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily xxunk by the clever white xxunk xxmaj johnson and his wife . \\n\\n xxmaj one definite asset of these movies is the presence of xxmaj osa xxmaj johnson . xxmaj ten years younger than her husband , she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . xxmaj while certainly not as attractive as the xxunk blond xxmaj esther xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj osa xxmaj johnson was a xxunk brunette who gave xxunk performances in front of the camera in all the films she co - produced with her husband . \\n\\n ' congorilla ' is probably the best of the xxmaj johnsons ' films . xxmaj the shots of the xxmaj xxunk are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 . xxmaj the shots of the xxmaj xxunk and other natives are also interesting , although these suffer from the xxmaj johnsons ' xxunk to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look ' wild ' and alien . \\n\\n xxmaj the best ( and funniest ) scene in ' congorilla ' is an improvised sequence in which xxmaj osa xxmaj johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some xxmaj xxunk women .
