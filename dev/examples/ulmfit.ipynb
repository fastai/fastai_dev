       "      <td>xxbos i felt duty bound to watch the 1983 xxmaj timothy xxmaj dalton / xxmaj zelah xxmaj clarke adaptation of \" jane xxmaj eyre , \" because xxmaj i 'd just written an article about the 2006 xxup bbc \" jane xxmaj eyre \" for xxunk . \\n\\n xxmaj so , i approached watching this the way xxmaj i 'd approach doing homework . \\n\\n i was irritated at first . xxmaj the lighting in this version is bad . xxmaj everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white xxunk light that , in some scenes , casts shadows on the wall behind the characters . \\n\\n xxmaj and the sound is poorly recorded . i felt like i was listening to a high school play . \\n\\n xxmaj and the pancake make - up is way too heavy . \\n\\n xxmaj and the sets do n't fully convey the xxmaj gothic mood of the novel . xxmaj they are too fussy , too xxmaj martha xxmaj stewart . i just ca n't see xxmaj bronte 's xxmaj rochester abiding such xxmaj martha xxmaj stewart domestic arrangements . xxmaj orson xxmaj welles ' xxmaj rochester lived in cave - like gloom , very appropriate to the novel 's xxmaj gothic mood . \\n\\n xxmaj and yet … with all those objections … not only is this the best \" jane xxmaj eyre \" xxmaj i 've seen , it may be the best adaptation of any novel xxmaj i 've ever seen . \\n\\n xxmaj this \" jane xxmaj eyre , \" in spite of its technical flaws , brought the feeling back to me of reading \" jane xxmaj eyre \" for the first time . \\n\\n xxmaj the critics of this production say it is too close to the book . xxmaj for me , someone who valued the book and did n't need it to be any less \" wordy \" or any less \" christian \" or any more sexed up , this version 's faithfulness to the novel xxmaj bronte actually wrote is its finest asset . \\n\\n xxmaj bronte wrote a darn good book . xxmaj there 's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus , while other , slicker , sexier and easier texts , have disappeared . \\n\\n xxmaj as a long time \" jane xxmaj eyre \" fan , i was prejudiced against xxmaj timothy xxmaj dalton as xxmaj rochester . xxmaj rochester is , famously , not handsome ; xxmaj jane and xxmaj rochester are literature 's famous ugly couple . xxmaj and xxmaj timothy xxmaj dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome . \\n\\n xxmaj but xxmaj dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as xxmaj rochester . xxmaj he just blew me away . xxmaj i 've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role , the text , the dialogue , and xxmaj rochester 's love for xxmaj jane . xxmaj dalton brings the page 's xxmaj rochester to quivering life on screen . \\n\\n xxmaj rochester is meant to be a bit scary . xxmaj dalton is scary . xxmaj welles got the scary streak down , too , for example , when he shouts \" enough ! \" after xxmaj fontaine plays a short piano piece . xxmaj but xxmaj dalton is scary more than once , here . xxmaj you really ca n't tell if he 's going to hurt xxmaj jane , or himself , in his desperation . \\n\\n xxmaj rochester 's xxunk , his humor , his rage , his vulnerability : xxmaj dalton conveys all , sometimes seconds apart . xxmaj it 's stunning . \\n\\n xxmaj and here 's the key thing -- the actor performing xxmaj rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair , lonely , living with an ugly , life - destroying secret . \\n\\n xxmaj no other actor xxmaj i 've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as xxmaj timothy xxmaj dalton does . xxmaj current fan favorite xxmaj toby xxmaj stephens does n't even try . xxmaj dalton hits it out of the park . xxmaj if i saw xxmaj timothy xxmaj dalton performing xxmaj rochester in a singles bar , i would say , \" that guy is trouble . xxmaj do n't even look at him . \" xxmaj he 's that radioactive with xxunk down agony . \\n\\n xxmaj zelah xxmaj clarke is not only , overall , the best xxmaj jane xxmaj i 've seen , she 's one of the very few xxmaj janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts xxmaj jane . xxmaj no , folks who know \" jane xxmaj eyre \" only from the 2006 version , xxmaj bronte did * not * describe a statuesque , robust xxmaj jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips . xxmaj rather , xxmaj charlotte xxmaj bronte 's xxmaj jane is , indeed , poor , plain , obscure , and little , and xxup not pretty . \\n\\n xxmaj zelah has a small mouth , close - set eyes , and a bit of a nose . xxmaj she 's truly \" little . \" xxmaj she is no fashion model . xxmaj and she is the best xxmaj jane , the truest to the book . \\n\\n xxmaj some described her a cold or boring . xxmaj no , she 's true to the book . xxmaj bronte 's xxmaj jane is not a red hot mama , she 's a sheltered , deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments , as xxmaj zelah 's do here . xxmaj the book 's xxmaj jane is someone you have to watch slowly , carefully , patiently , xxunk , if you want to truly plumb her depths . xxmaj you have to watch xxmaj zelah , here , to get to know who she really is . \\n\\n i would have liked to have seen more fire in xxmaj zelah in one key scene , but that 's one scene out of five hours in which she is , otherwise , very good . \\n\\n xxmaj in spite of its closeness to the text , this version , like every other version xxmaj i 've seen , xxunk away from fully xxunk the overtly xxmaj christian themes in \" jane xxmaj eyre . \" xxmaj christianity is not incidental subtext in \" jane xxmaj eyre , \" it is central . \\n\\n xxmaj helen xxmaj burns instructs xxmaj jane in xxmaj christianity , thus giving her a subversive , counter cultural way to read , and live , her apparently doomed , pinched life . xxmaj it is xxmaj christianity , and a xxmaj christian xxmaj god , who convinces poor , plain , obscure xxmaj jane of her equal worth , her need to live up to her ideals , and her rejection of a key marriage proposal . xxmaj that is n't made fully clear here . \\n\\n xxmaj in any case , xxmaj charlotte xxmaj bronte wrote an excellent , complex , rich novel , and this adaptation of it , of all the ones xxmaj i 've seen , mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation xxmaj i 've seen , and that says a lot . \\n\\n xxmaj other versions , that do n't fully honor the book , end up being a chore to watch in many places . xxmaj if you do n't care about what xxmaj charlotte xxmaj bronte has to say about child abuse , or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money , your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between xxmaj jane and xxmaj rochester . \\n\\n xxmaj this version , like xxmaj bronte 's novel , realizes that everything xxmaj bronte wrote -- about xxmaj jane 's experiences at xxmaj lowood , and her relationship to xxmaj st . xxmaj john -- are part of what makes xxmaj jane 's relationship to xxmaj rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is .</td>\n",
